Growth,"Manufacturing PMI®The U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in April, as the Manufacturing PMI® registered 47.1 percent, 0.8 percentage point higher than the reading of 46.3 percent recorded in March. “This is the sixth month of contraction and continuation of a downward trend that began in June 2022. Of the five subindexes that directly factor into the Manufacturing PMI®, only one (Employment) is in growth territory. Of the six biggest manufacturing industries, two (Petroleum & Coal Products; and Transportation Equipment) registered growth in April. The Production Index logged a fifth month in contraction territory. Three of the 10 subindexes were above 50 percent for the period,” says Fiore. A reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing sector is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally contracting.A Manufacturing PMI® above 48.7 percent, over a period of time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy. Therefore, the April Manufacturing PMI® indicates the overall economy contracted in April for a fifth consecutive month after 30 straight months of expansion. “The past relationship between the Manufacturing PMI® and the overall economy indicates that the April reading (47.1 percent) corresponds to a change of minus-0.6 percent in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis,” says Fiore.<"
New Orders,"New OrdersISM®’s New Orders Index contracted for the eighth consecutive month in April, registering 45.7 percent, an increase of 1.4 percentage points compared to March’s reading of 44.3 percent. “Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, two (Petroleum & Coal Products; and Transportation Equipment) reported increased new orders. New orders contraction slowed as panelists’ companies continue to experience uncertainty regarding future customer demand,” says Fiore. (For more on lead times, see the Buying Policy section of this report.) A New Orders Index above 52.7 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Census Bureau’s series on manufacturing orders (in constant 2000 dollars).The eight manufacturing industries that reported growth in new orders in April — in the following order — are: Printing & Related Support Activities; Paper Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Petroleum & Coal Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; and Transportation Equipment. Six industries reported a decline in new orders in April, in the following order: Furniture & Related Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Chemical Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Machinery; and Primary Metals."
Production,"ProductionThe Production Index registered 48.9 percent in April, 1.1 percentage points higher than the March reading of 47.8 percent, indicating a fifth month of contraction after 30 consecutive months of growth. “Of the top six industries, four — Transportation Equipment; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Machinery; and Computer & Electronic Products — expanded in April. The index recorded its best performance since it went into contraction in December 2022. Weak contraction in the Production Index continues to support manufacturing executives’ strategy to stretch out output during the first half of 2023, as panelists’ companies attempt to retain sufficient workers to prepare for better second-half performance,” says Fiore. An index above 52.2 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Federal Reserve Board’s Industrial Production figures.The 11 industries reporting growth in production during the month of April are, in order: Printing & Related Support Activities; Fabricated Metal Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; Transportation Equipment; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Plastics & Rubber Products; Machinery; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; and Computer & Electronic Products. The five industries reporting a decrease in production in April are: Textile Mills; Furniture & Related Products; Wood Products; Paper Products; and Chemical Products."
Employment,"EmploymentISM®’s Employment Index registered 50.2 percent in April, 3.3 percentage points higher than the March reading of 46.9 percent. “The index indicated employment expanded after two months of contraction. Of the six big manufacturing sectors, three (Transportation Equipment; Machinery; and Chemical Products) expanded. For the second straight month, labor management sentiment at panelists’ companies reflects near parity between hiring and staffing reductions. Turnover rates declined in April, recording the lowest levels since measurements began in mid-2021. For those companies increasing their head counts, comments continue to support an improving hiring environment,” says Fiore. An Employment Index above 50.4 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on manufacturing employment.Of 18 manufacturing industries, seven reported employment growth in April, in the following order: Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Paper Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Transportation Equipment; Plastics & Rubber Products; Machinery; and Chemical Products. The five industries reporting a decrease in employment in April are: Textile Mills; Furniture & Related Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; and Computer & Electronic Products. Six industries reported no change in employment."
Supplier Deliveries,"Supplier Deliveries*The delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations was faster for a seventh straight month in April, as the Supplier Deliveries Index registered 44.6 percent, 0.2 percentage point lower than the 44.8 percent reported in March. This month’s reading indicates the fastest supplier delivery performance since March 2009, when the index registered 43.2 percent. Of the top six manufacturing industries, only Computer & Electronic Products reported slower deliveries. “Panelists’ comments now indicate that suppliers have excess capacity to meet all of their customers’ current demand forecasts,” says Fiore. A reading below 50 percent indicates faster deliveries, while a reading above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries.Three of 18 manufacturing industries reported slower supplier deliveries in April: Textile Mills; Primary Metals; and Computer & Electronic Products. The 10 industries reporting faster supplier deliveries in April as compared to March — in the following order — are: Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Plastics & Rubber Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Machinery; Paper Products; Furniture & Related Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Fabricated Metal Products; and Chemical Products."
Inventories,"InventoriesThe Inventories Index registered 46.3 percent in April, 1.2 percentage points lower than the 47.5 percent reported for March. “Manufacturing inventories contracted at a faster rate compared to March. Of the six big manufacturing industries, only one (Petroleum & Coal Products) increased manufacturing inventories in April. Manufacturing inventory levels recorded their lowest performance since August 2020, when the index registered 44.9 percent. Manufacturing inventories continue to be managed down by panelists’ companies as they prepare for lower production output,” says Fiore. An Inventories Index greater than 44.4 percent, over time, is generally consistent with expansion in the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) figures on overall manufacturing inventories (in chained 2000 dollars).Of 18 manufacturing industries, the five reporting higher inventories in April are: Printing & Related Support Activities; Textile Mills; Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Petroleum & Coal Products; and Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components. The 12 industries reporting contracting inventories in April — in the following order — are: Furniture & Related Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; Wood Products; Machinery; Fabricated Metal Products; Transportation Equipment; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Chemical Products; and Computer & Electronic Products."
Customers Inventories,"Customers' Inventories*ISM®’s Customers’ Inventories Index registered 51.3 percent in April, 2.4 percentage points higher than the 48.9 percent reported for March. “Customers’ inventory levels are now at the low end of the ‘too high’ level as panelists report their companies’ customers have signaled suppliers to deliver less material in the future. In April, customer inventories reached levels likely not conducive to future output growth,” says Fiore.The seven industries reporting customers’ inventories as too high in April are, in order: Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Paper Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Furniture & Related Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Fabricated Metal Products; and Plastics & Rubber Products. The six industries reporting customers’ inventories as too low in April are, in order: Textile Mills; Primary Metals; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Machinery; Transportation Equipment; and Chemical Products."
Raw Material Prices,"Prices*The ISM® Prices Index registered 53.2 percent, 4 percentage points higher compared to the March reading of 49.2 percent, indicating raw materials prices increased in April. The index returned to expansion (or “increasing”) territory after one month in contraction. “Panelists’ comments support a more balanced supplier-buyer relationship, as sellers are more concerned about filling order books to support their backlogs. Price increases for foundational purchased materials like steel, copper, plastics and diesel continue to put upward pressure on material costs. Of the top six manufacturing industries, four (Petroleum & Coal Products; Machinery; Transportation Equipment; and Computer & Electronic Products) reported price increases in April. Panelists’ companies reporting ‘higher’ prices (26 percent in April, up from 21 percent in March) support a general trend that price reductions may have ended in the near- to medium-term,” says Fiore. A Prices Index above 52.9 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Producer Price Index for Intermediate Materials.In April, nine industries — in the following order — reported paying increased prices for raw materials: Petroleum & Coal Products; Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Machinery; Transportation Equipment; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Fabricated Metal Products; and Computer & Electronic Products. The seven industries reporting paying decreased prices for raw materials in April — in the following order — are: Paper Products; Wood Products; Textile Mills; Chemical Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Primary Metals; and Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components."
Backlog of Orders,"Backlog of Orders*ISM®’s Backlog of Orders Index registered 43.1 percent in April, a 0.8-percentage point decrease compared to March’s reading of 43.9 percent, indicating order backlogs contracted for the seventh consecutive month after a 27-month period of expansion. Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, none expanded order backlogs in April. “The index remains in strong contraction as factories continue to work backlogs down amid weak new order levels,” says Fiore.Three industries reported growth in order backlogs in April: Printing & Related Support Activities; Textile Mills; and Paper Products. Thirteen industries reported lower backlogs in April, in the following order: Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Wood Products; Furniture & Related Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Plastics & Rubber Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Chemical Products; Machinery; Transportation Equipment; Primary Metals; Computer & Electronic Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Fabricated Metal Products."
Exports,"New Export Orders*ISM®’s New Export Orders Index registered 49.8 percent in April, 2.2 percentage points higher than the March reading of 47.6 percent. “The New Export Orders Index contracted in April for the ninth consecutive month after 25 straight months in expansion territory, but the index registers near parity with the month of February. Comments supported improved order levels from China and Europe, but as was the case in March, activity remains weak,” says Fiore.Five industries reported growth in new export orders in April: Printing & Related Support Activities; Wood Products; Paper Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing. The seven industries reporting a decrease in new export orders in April — in the following order — are: Furniture & Related Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Machinery; Chemical Products; and Transportation Equipment. Six industries reported no change in exports in April compared to March."
