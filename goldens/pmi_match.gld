Growth,"Manufacturing PMI®The U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in March, as the Manufacturing PMI® registered 46.3 percent, 1.4 percentage points lower than the reading of 47.7 percent recorded in February. “This is the fifth month of contraction and continuation of a downward trend that began in June 2022. Of the five subindexes that directly factor into the Manufacturing PMI®, none were in growth territory. This month, the PMI® registered its lowest reading since May 2020 (43.5 percent). Of the six biggest manufacturing industries, two (Petroleum & Coal Products; and Machinery) registered growth in March. The Production Index logged a fourth month in contraction territory. None of the 10 subindexes were positive for the period,” says Fiore. A reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing sector is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally contracting.A Manufacturing PMI® above 48.7 percent, over a period of time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy. Therefore, the March Manufacturing PMI® indicates the overall economy contracted in March for a fourth consecutive month after 30 straight months of expansion. “The past relationship between the Manufacturing PMI® and the overall economy indicates that the March reading (46.3 percent) corresponds to a change of minus-0.9 percent in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis,” says Fiore.<"
New Orders,"New OrdersISM®’s New Orders Index contracted for the seventh consecutive month in March, registering 44.3 percent, a decrease of 2.7 percentage points compared to February’s reading of 47 percent. “Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, one (Petroleum & Coal Products) reported increased new orders. New orders contraction quickened as uncertainty regarding future demand continues to hold the index back from more notable improvement,” says Fiore. (For more on lead times, see the Buying Policy section of this report.) A New Orders Index above 52.7 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Census Bureau’s series on manufacturing orders (in constant 2000 dollars).The five manufacturing industries that reported growth in new orders in March are: Printing & Related Support Activities; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Primary Metals; Petroleum & Coal Products; and Fabricated Metal Products. Eleven industries reported a decline in new orders in March, in the following order: Paper Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Furniture & Related Products; Textile Mills; Plastics & Rubber Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Transportation Equipment; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Machinery; and Chemical Products."
Production,"ProductionThe Production Index registered 47.8 percent in March, 0.5 percentage point higher than the February reading of 47.3 percent, indicating a fourth month of contraction after 30 consecutive months of growth. “Of the top six industries, only three — Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Transportation Equipment; and Machinery — expanded in March. Weak contraction in the Production Index continues to support manufacturing executives’ strategy to extend output during the first half of 2023, as panelists’ companies attempt to retain sufficient workers to prepare for better second-half performance. In the last two months, the index recorded its lowest readings since May 2020 (34.2 percent),” says Fiore. An index above 52.2 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Federal Reserve Board’s Industrial Production figures.The eight industries reporting growth in production during the month of March are, in order: Printing & Related Support Activities; Fabricated Metal Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Primary Metals; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Transportation Equipment; and Machinery. The eight industries reporting a decrease in production in March — in the following order — are: Paper Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Furniture & Related Products; Textile Mills; Wood Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Petroleum & Coal Products; and Chemical Products."
Employment,"EmploymentISM®’s Employment Index registered 46.9 percent in March, 2.2 percentage points lower than the February reading of 49.1 percent. “The index indicated employment contracted again, continuing a trend of weak performance since September 2022. Of the six big manufacturing sectors, only two (Machinery; and Transportation Equipment) expanded. Labor management sentiment at panelists’ companies is approaching parity (near equal levels of hiring and staffing reductions). Companies are attempting to maintain workforce levels to support projected second-half growth, but to a lesser degree compared to February. Turnover rates in March were consistent with February, with both months recording their lowest levels since measurements began in mid-2021. For those companies increasing their head counts, comments continue to support an improving hiring environment,” says Fiore. An Employment Index above 50.4 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on manufacturing employment.Of 18 manufacturing industries, six reported employment growth in March, in the following order: Printing & Related Support Activities; Primary Metals; Machinery; Fabricated Metal Products; Transportation Equipment; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing. The six industries reporting a decrease in employment in March, in order, are: Textile Mills; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Computer & Electronic Products; and Chemical Products. Six industries reported no change in employment."
Supplier Deliveries,"Supplier Deliveries*The delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations was faster for a sixth straight month in March, as the Supplier Deliveries Index registered 44.8 percent, 0.4 percentage point lower than the 45.2 percent reported in February. This month’s reading indicates the fastest supplier delivery performance since March 2009, when the index registered 43.2 percent. Of the top six manufacturing industries, only Petroleum & Coal Products reported slower deliveries. “Panelist comments indicate that suppliers continue to have sufficient capacity levels to meet their current demand forecasts,” says Fiore. A reading below 50 percent indicates faster deliveries, while a reading above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries.Two of 18 manufacturing industries reported slower supplier deliveries in March: Petroleum & Coal Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing. The 12 industries reporting faster supplier deliveries in March as compared to February — in the following order — are: Plastics & Rubber Products; Wood Products; Paper Products; Furniture & Related Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Chemical Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Primary Metals; Fabricated Metal Products; Machinery; and Transportation Equipment."
Inventories,"InventoriesThe Inventories Index registered 47.5 percent in March, 2.6 percentage points lower than the 50.1 percent reported for February. “Manufacturing inventories contracted compared to February. Of the six big manufacturing industries, two (Machinery; and Computer & Electronic Products) increased manufacturing inventories in March. Manufacturing inventories continue to be effectively managed by panelists’ companies as they work down total supply chain inventories,” says Fiore. An Inventories Index greater than 44.4 percent, over time, is generally consistent with expansion in the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) figures on overall manufacturing inventories (in chained 2000 dollars).Of 18 manufacturing industries, the seven reporting higher inventories in March — in the following order — are: Printing & Related Support Activities; Textile Mills; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Paper Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Machinery; and Computer & Electronic Products. The seven industries reporting contracting inventories in March — in the following order — are: Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Furniture & Related Products; Wood Products; Primary Metals; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Chemical Products; and Transportation Equipment."
Customers Inventories,"Customers' Inventories*ISM®’s Customers’ Inventories Index registered 48.9 percent in March, 2 percentage points higher than the 46.9 percent reported for February. “Customers’ inventory levels are now at the low end of the ‘just right’ level, as panelists’ companies continue to manage total supply chain inventories. March saw customer inventories approach restrictive levels for future output growth potential,” says Fiore.Five industries reported customers’ inventories as too high in March: Paper Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Furniture & Related Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; and Computer & Electronic Products. The five industries reporting customers’ inventories as too low in March are: Primary Metals; Petroleum & Coal Products; Machinery; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Chemical Products. Seven industries reported no change in customers’ inventories in March compared to February."
Raw Material Prices,"Prices*The ISM® Prices Index registered 49.2 percent, 2.1 percentage points lower compared to the February reading of 51.3 percent, indicating raw materials prices decreased in March. The index dropped back into contraction (or “decreasing”) territory after one month in expansion preceded by four straight months below 50 percent. “Panelists’ comments support a return to more balanced supplier-buyer relationships. Sellers are more interested in filling order books, as demonstrated by panelists’ comments supporting reduced lead times. Also, future price increases are apparent for foundational purchased materials (steel, copper and aluminum). Of the top six manufacturing industries, two (Machinery; and Transportation Equipment) reported price increases in March. Panelists’ companies reporting ‘same’ or ‘lower’ prices (79 percent in March and 75 percent in February) support buyers beginning to increase their new order rates,” says Fiore. A Prices Index above 52.9 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Producer Price Index for Intermediate Materials.In March, eight industries — in the following order — reported paying increased prices for raw materials: Machinery; Plastics & Rubber Products; Transportation Equipment; Fabricated Metal Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing. The eight industries reporting paying decreased prices for raw materials in March — in the following order — are: Wood Products; Petroleum & Coal Products; Textile Mills; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Paper Products; Furniture & Related Products; Chemical Products; and Computer & Electronic Products."
Backlog of Orders,"Backlog of Orders*ISM®’s Backlog of Orders Index registered 43.9 percent in March, a 1.2-percentage point decrease compared to February’s reading of 45.1 percent, indicating order backlogs contracted for the sixth consecutive month after a 27-month period of expansion. Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, one — Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products — expanded order backlogs in March. “The index continues to contract as adequately staffed factory floors work backlogs down amid weak new order levels and supplier delivery improvements,” says Fiore.Two industries reported growth in order backlogs in March: Textile Mills; and Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products. Twelve industries reported lower backlogs in March, in the following order: Wood Products; Furniture & Related Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Transportation Equipment; Plastics & Rubber Products; Paper Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Chemical Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Primary Metals; Computer & Electronic Products; and Machinery."
Exports,"New Export Orders*ISM®’s New Export Orders Index registered 47.6 percent in March, 2.3 percentage points lower than the February reading of 49.9 percent. “The New Export Orders Index contracted in March for the eighth consecutive month after 25 straight months in expansion territory. Comments supported improved order levels from China and Europe, but activity remains weak,” says Fiore.Four industries reported growth in new export orders in March: Printing & Related Support Activities; Textile Mills; Paper Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing. The nine industries reporting a decrease in new export orders in March — in the following order — are: Wood Products; Furniture & Related Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Machinery; Chemical Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Computer & Electronic Products; and Transportation Equipment."
